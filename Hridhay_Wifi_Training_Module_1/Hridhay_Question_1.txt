The Wifi standard/protocol fits in both Physical Layer (Layer 1) and Datalink Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.

The Physical Layer consists of two sublayers: PLCP (Physical Layer Convergence Procedure) and PMD (Physical Medium Dependent). The PLCP adds a preamble and PHY header to each frame, ensuring that radios can synchronize before data transmission. It also determines the PHY rate at which data (MPDU/PSDU) will be transmitted. The PMD sublayer is responsible for converting data into bits (0s and 1s) and employs various modulation techniques such as BPSK, QPSK, QAM, and CCK to encode data efficiently. As distance from the transmitter increases, devices automatically shift to simpler modulations to maintain communication. Wi-Fi also employs different modulation types such as DSSS (Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum), OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing), and MIMO-OFDM (Multiple Input Multiple Output - OFDM) for better performance. Spectrum analyzers play a crucial role at Layer 1, helping to monitor Wi-Fi signals and detect interference.  

At Layer 2 (Data Link Layer), Wi-Fi operates through two sublayers: LLC (Logical Link Control) and MAC (Media Access Control). The LLC sublayer receives data from Layer 3 as an MSDU (MAC Service Data Unit), which contains information from Layers 3-7. This data is then passed to the MAC sublayer, which adds essential Layer 2 information such as MAC addresses (source, destination, and BSSID). While Ethernet (802.3) uses two MAC addresses (source & destination), Wi-Fi (802.11) typically uses three, and in mesh or WDS (Wireless Distribution System) networks, a fourth MAC address is used. At this stage, data is referred to as an MPDU (MAC Protocol Data Unit). 802.11 sniffers play a vital role at this layer, capturing and analyzing Wi-Fi frames to diagnose network issues.
