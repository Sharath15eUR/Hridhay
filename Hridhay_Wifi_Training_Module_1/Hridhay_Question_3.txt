Basic Service Set(BSS) is a network topology that allows all wireless devices to communicate with each other through a common access point.
Any wireless device or station that wants to send an association request to the access point it has to match the following requirements.

1) Matching SSID (Service Set Identifier). It is the MAC address of the AP associated with the BSS.  
2) Compatible wireless data rate i.e., transmission speed or speed at which data is transferred between stations. 
3) Authentication credentials i.e., verification of the clientâ€™s identity. 

BSS provides short-range wireless communication and such an area is known as BSA (Basic Service Area). 

Extended Service Set (ESS) is a set of interconnected wireless access points and stations that group together to form a single logical network. Extended service sets allow devices to roam seamlessly between access points without losing their network connection. It connects multiple BSS together, as a result when a device moves out of range of one AP, it is automatically connected to another AP. Each ESS is uniquely identified by a unique SSID.
