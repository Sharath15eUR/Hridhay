The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is an organization that develops and maintains technical standards for various technologies, including networking and wireless communication. It created 802.11 family of standards, which define how Wi-Fi networks operate, including aspects like frequency bands, data transmission speeds, security protocols, and modulation techniques. IEEE focuses on ensuring that wireless communication technologies are designed efficiently and meet industry needs. However, IEEE does not handle device certification or consumer branding; its role is strictly in standardization and development.  

The Wi-Fi Alliance (WFA), on the other hand, is an organization that ensures interoperability and certification of Wi-Fi products. While IEEE defines how Wi-Fi technology should work, the WFA takes those standards and ensures that devices from different manufacturers comply with them and can function together seamlessly. The Wi-Fi Alliance also simplifies branding for consumers by introducing names like Wi-Fi 4 (802.11n), Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac), and Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) instead of using complex technical terms. In addition to certification, WFA promotes Wi-Fi advancements, security features, and best practices for the industry, making it a key player in ensuring the reliability and usability of Wi-Fi technology worldwide.
