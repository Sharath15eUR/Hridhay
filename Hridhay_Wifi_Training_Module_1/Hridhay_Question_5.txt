In bridge mode two access points are linked to form a communication bridge allowing data transmissions between devices on either side of the bridge. This results in extending the coverage of the network. The wireless access points configuration uses a private wireless network only accessible by the access points involved in the bridge. One of the major advantages of wireless bridging is the expansion of communications in areas that are too expensive to add communication cabling or in hazardous areas that would typically be off-limits.

In repeater mode a wireless repeater is connected to an access point to boost the wireless signals as result increasing the coverage area of the network. The repeaters receive the signal from the AP and copies it bit by bit and then sends it to the receiver .Multiple repeaters can be linked together to transmit data much further distances. Because repeaters continuously monitor signals generated between LANs, they can greatly enhance network reliability and flexibility.
