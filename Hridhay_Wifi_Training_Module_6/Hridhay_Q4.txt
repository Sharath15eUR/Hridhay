WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) is viewed as highly insecure because it relies on outdated encryption methods, using the weak RC4 cipher and very short key lengths of 40 or 104 bits. Its 24-bit Initialization Vector (IV) is small, leading to frequent repetitions that make it easy for attackers to capture data packets and quickly crack the encryption key. Additionally, WEP uses static keys that do not change, further increasing the risk of compromise. On the other hand, WPA2 and WPA3 offer much stronger security by using advanced encryption standards like AES (in WPA2) and AES with GCMP (in WPA3), along with dynamic key exchange protocols such as the 4-way handshake and Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE). These enhancements greatly reduce the chances of attacks like eavesdropping, brute-force cracking, and key re-use vulnerabilities, providing a much higher level of protection compared to WEP.
