The 4-way handshake ensures mutual authentication between the client and the access point by allowing both sides to prove that they possess the same Pairwise Master Key (PMK) without actually transmitting it. During the handshake, the access point sends a random number (called a nonce) to the client. The client uses this nonce, along with its own random value, to create a Pairwise Transient Key (PTK) and sends back a response. Both sides independently compute the PTK, and if their calculations match, it proves that both parties have the correct PMK. This exchange ensures that both the client and the AP trust each other, establishing a secure connection without ever exposing the PMK over the network.
