If the client enters a wrong passphrase during the 4-way handshake, the Pairwise Master Key (PMK) generated by the client will not match the PMK expected by the access point. As a result, when the client and AP attempt to derive and verify the Pairwise Transient Key (PTK) during the handshake, their calculations will not match because the Message Integrity Code (MIC) check will fail (the MIC generated from the incorrect PTK will not validate properly), the handshake will not complete successfully.
