The Pairwise Master Key (PMK) is like the secret password both your device and the Wi-Fi router agree on before they trust each other. It’s either created from the Wi-Fi password you enter (in personal networks) or given by a secure server (in enterprise setups). During the 4-way handshake, this PMK isn’t sent out directly. Instead, it’s used to create a temporary key called the Pairwise Transient Key (PTK). This PTK is what actually protects your data while you’re connected. The whole idea is that your device and the router can make sure they both know the right secret (the PMK) without revealing it to any other node keeping your connection safe from anyone who might be trying to listen in.
