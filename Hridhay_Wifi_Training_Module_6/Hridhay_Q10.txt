802.1X improves wireless network security by requiring devices to authenticate before gaining access to the network. It enforces strong, identity-based access control using the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP),by creating a virtual port that initially blocks general network traffic until authentication is successful, 802.1X prevents unauthorized users from communicating with network resources.It supports mutual authentication between the client and the network, helping prevent impersonation attacks and additionally, it allows dynamic key generation after authentication, which ensures that each session is uniquely secured, reducing the risk of key reuse or interception. Overall, 802.1X ensures that only properly authenticated and authorized users can access the network, significantly strengthening wireless security.
