802.1X solves the problem of unauthorized network access by providing a framework for strong authentication before a device can connect to the network. It acts as a gatekeeper, making sure that only authenticated and authorized users or devices are allowed to access network resources. Without 802.1X, anyone who physically connects to a network port or joins a wireless network could potentially gain access without proving their identity, leading to major security risks and with 802.1X, authentication happens first — using credentials like usernames/passwords, certificates, or smartcards — before full network access is granted.
