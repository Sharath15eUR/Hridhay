Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a device or user before allowing access to the network. It ensures that only authorized users can connect.
Encryption, on the other hand, is about protecting the data that is transmitted after authentication. Once you are connected, encryption ensures that the information you send over the Wi-Fi network is scrambled in such a way that only intended recipients can understand it. Even if someone intercepts the wireless signal, they cannot read the encrypted data without the correct decryption key.
