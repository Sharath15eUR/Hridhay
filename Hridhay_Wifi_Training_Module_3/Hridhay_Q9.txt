In a MIMO, an AP can communicate with only one terminal at a time. This is why MIMO is sometimes also known as single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO). When the number of antennas on a terminal is the same as that on an AP, space resources of the AP can be fully effective. 

MU-MIMO (Multi-User MIMO) is an advanced form of MIMO that allows a wireless access point to transmit data to multiple devices at the same time, instead of serving them one by one. This increases overall network efficiency, reduces congestion, and is especially beneficial in environments with many users.
