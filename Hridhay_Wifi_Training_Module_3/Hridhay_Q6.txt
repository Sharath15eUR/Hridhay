A Guard Interval (GI) is a period of time between symbol transmissions. It allows reflections from previous data transmissions to settle before transmitting a new symbol. A shorter Guard Interval (e.g., 400 ns instead of the standard 800 ns) reduces the time wasted between transmissions, thereby improving data throughput. This works best in environments with minimal signal reflections. By minimizing idle time between symbols, short GIs increase the number of symbols transmitted per second, boosting overall network efficiency
