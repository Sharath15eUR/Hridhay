The data rate in Wi-Fi is calculated using the formula:
Data Rate = (Number of Data Subcarriers) × (Bits per Subcarrier) × (Coding Rate) × (Symbol Rate)

1)Number of Data Subcarriers: Depends on channel bandwidth.
2)Bits per Subcarrier: Based on modulation scheme.
3)Coding Rate: Represents FEC efficiency.
4)Symbol Rate: Determined by OFDM symbol duration.
