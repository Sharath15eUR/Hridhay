OFDM is a type of multi-carrier transmission which works by splitting a high-rate data stream into multiple lower-rate streams, which are then transmitted simultaneously over many narrowband, orthogonal subcarriers. These subcarriers are spaced closely together in the frequency domain, but due to their mathematical orthogonality, they do not interfere with each other. This allows OFDM to utilize the available bandwidth more efficiently than traditional single-carrier systems.

OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) is an extension of OFDM that allows multiple users to share the subcarriers simultaneously. Each user is assigned a subset of subcarriers, enabling parallel transmission to or from multiple devices in the same time slot. This improves spectral efficiency and reduces latency, especially in dense environments.
