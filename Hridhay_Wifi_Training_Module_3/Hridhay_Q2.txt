DSSS:
It is a transmission technology that works by spreading the signal over a larger bandwidth that is required for simple transmission. The original data signal is combined with a higher rate bit sequence, also known as a chipping code, to increase the signalâ€™s bandwidth. The transmitter takes the original data signal and multiplies it with a chipping code, resulting in a wider frequency spectrum signal. This chipping code, or pseudorandom code, is a sequence of 0s and 1s at a much higher frequency than the original signal. The receiver, using the same chipping code, can then de-spread the spread signal and retrieve the original data. Even if a part of the signal is affected during transmission, the receiver can still recover the original data, thereby reducing the potential for data loss or corruption.

FHSS:
Frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) transmission is the repeated switching of the carrier frequency during radio transmission to reduce interference and avoid interception. The transmitter hops between available narrowband frequencies within a specified broad channel in a pseudo-random sequence known to both sender and receiver. A short burst of data is transmitted on the current narrowband channel, and then the transmitter and receiver tune to the next frequency in the sequence for the next burst of data. In most systems, the transmitter will hop to a new frequency more than twice per second.
