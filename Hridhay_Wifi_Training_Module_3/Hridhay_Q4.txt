OFDM is a type of multi-carrier transmission which works by splitting a high-rate data stream into multiple lower-rate streams, which are then transmitted simultaneously over many narrowband, orthogonal subcarriers. These subcarriers are spaced closely together in the frequency domain, but due to their mathematical orthogonality, they do not interfere with each other. This allows OFDM to utilize the available bandwidth more efficiently than traditional single-carrier systems.

It is used in WLAN because of orthogonality among the subcarriers not only helps in preventing Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) from multiple copies of the same signal but also helps in avoiding interference among transmissions from neighbouring cells. OFDM bypasses the need for a long equalizer as in single-carrier systems and requires a computational load of only 1 division operation per subcarrier as the equalization part. This turns out to be a huge savings in complexity for high rate wireless communication systems in which the symbol time is short resulting in long channel response.
