In local mode the lightweight AP is completely dependent on the WLC for management and control functions. As a result if the WLC is down then the connection between the client and the AP is dropped. All traffic is dropped. The AP will keep trying to reconnect with the WLC. The connection resumes once the AP connects with the WLC. New clients wont be able to connect with the WLC down
