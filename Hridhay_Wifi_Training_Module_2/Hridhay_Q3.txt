CAPWAP operates in Layer 3 of the OSI model that is the network layer, since it allows communication between AP's and WLC over IP networks.

There are two tunnel types:
1)CAPWAP control messages: contain information about WLAN management. We use this to configure and manage the AP. These control messages are encrypted.
2)CAPWAP data messages: encapsulate packets to and from wireless clients who are associated with the AP. These messages are unencrypted by default
Each uses a different UDP port.Tunneled traffic can be switched or routed. Using a tunnel means the lightweight APs and WLC donâ€™t have to be in the same VLAN. This is useful since APs are typically on the access layer, and the WLC is in a central location (core layer or data center attached to the core).Because of the CAPWAP tunnel, the AP and WLC are not only physically separated but also logically separated.
