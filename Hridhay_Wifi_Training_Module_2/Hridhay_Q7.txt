The FlexConnect AP mode is the best for the local network. In this mode FlexConnect access points can switch client data traffic locally and perform client authentication locally when their connection to the controller is lost. When they are connected to the controller, they can also send traffic back to the controller. In the connected mode, the FlexConnect access point can also perform local authentication.A FlexConnect AP can, on a per-WLAN basis, either tunnel client data in CAPWAP to the controller (called Central Switching), or have client data egress at the APâ€™s LAN port (called Local Switching). With Locally Switched WLANs, the AP can tag client traffic in separate VLANs, to segregate the traffic from its management interface. If a FlexConnect AP should lose its CAPWAP connection to its controller, it goes into Standalone mode where Centrally Switched WLANs are down, but Locally Switched WLANs remain operational. If the Locally Switched WLAN is configured for Central Authentication, the associated clients remain connected when the AP goes into Standalone mode, but will be unable to form new associations. A Locally Switched WLAN that uses Local Authentication remains operational whether the AP is in Standalone or Connected mode.
