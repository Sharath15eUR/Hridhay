In the above scenario following are the challenges that will be faced
1) To achieve seamless roaming SSIDs and VLANs on all 50 AP's have to be configured which is a time consuming task.
2) Each AP has to be configured and administered manually which leads to a huge administrative workload.
3) Manual RF management is needed to tackle frequency and channel interference due to the presence of many APs.
4) Difficult to enforce security due to absence of centralized security enforcement,making it difficult to apply consistent WPA2/3, VLAN, ACLs, or firewall rules across all APs.
