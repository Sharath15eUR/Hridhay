The AP and WLC connect with a tunneling protocol, the Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) tunneling protocol. CAPWAP encapsulates all data between the lightweight AP and the WLC.There are two tunnel types:
1)CAPWAP control messages: contain information about WLAN management. We use this to configure and manage the AP. These control messages are encrypted.
2)CAPWAP data messages: encapsulate packets to and from wireless clients who are associated with the AP. These messages are unencrypted by default
Each uses a different UDP port.Tunneled traffic can be switched or routed. Using a tunnel means the lightweight APs and WLC donâ€™t have to be in the same VLAN. This is useful since APs are typically on the access layer, and the WLC is in a central location (core layer or data center attached to the core).Because of the CAPWAP tunnel, the AP and WLC are not only physically separated but also logically separated.

Data flow in upstream direction:
The AP encapsulates these frames into CAPWAP, forwarding them to the WLC's management IP. The WLC processes the frames, strips 802.11 headers, adds 802.3 headers, and sends them to the wired network.

Data Flow in downstream direction:
The WLC receives 802.3 frames, converts them to 802.11, encapsulates them in CAPWAP, and sends them to the appropriate AP.
