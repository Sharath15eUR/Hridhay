The fields of 802.11 MAC header are as follows:

Frame Control Field:
This field contains details about the frame type, transmission rate, and power management information.

Duration Field:
Indicates how long the wireless medium will be occupied by the current transmission.

Address Fields:
These fields hold the MAC addresses of the source and destination devices participating in the communication.

Sequence Control Field:
Used to track the order of transmitted frames and assist with managing frame sequencing.

Frame Body:
Carries the main payload, which may include IP packets, TCP segments, or UDP datagrams exchanged between devices.

Frame Check Sequence (FCS):
This field verifies the integrity of the frame's data and helps detect any errors during transmission.

Frame Types â€“ Management, Control, and Data:
802.11 MAC frames are categorized into three types: management frames for maintaining network operations, control frames for coordinating data flow, and data frames for transmitting user data.

Fragmentation:
To handle large data packets efficiently, the MAC layer supports fragmentation, splitting them into smaller pieces for transmission.

Acknowledgments:
Acknowledgment frames confirm the successful receipt of data and signal retransmission if any frames are lost or corrupted.
