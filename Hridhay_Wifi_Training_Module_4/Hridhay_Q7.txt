The MAC layer in WLAN plays a crucial role in conserving the power of wireless clients, which often operate on batteries. When a wireless client is idle but still associated with an access point (AP), it sends a "QoS NULL" frame with the power management bit set in the frame control (FC) field of the 802.11 header, then turns off its radio to save power. The client periodically wakes up based on the Beacon's Delivery Traffic Indication Message (DTIM) interval and checks the Traffic Indication Map (TIM) Information Element (IE) in the beacon. This includes the Partial Virtual Bitmap (PVB), a representation of the Association IDs (AIDs) of all associated stations. Each bit in the bitmap corresponds to an AID. If a client sees its AID bit set, it means the AP has pending data for it. The client then sends a PS-Poll frame to the AP to retrieve its data.
