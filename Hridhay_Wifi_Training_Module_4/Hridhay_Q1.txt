The MAC layer is positioned in the 2nd Layer of the OSI model which is the Datalink layer. It is a sublink of the data-layer. It is responsible for flow control and multiplexing for transmission medium. It controls the transmission of data packets via remotely shared channels. It sends data over the network interface card. MAC resolves addressing of source and groups of destination stations. It determines which node gets access to the channel for transmission and also handles collisions.
