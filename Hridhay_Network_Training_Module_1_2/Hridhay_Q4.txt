Ping
The ping command is a network utility tool that helps in determining network connectivity issues. It tests the connectivity between 2 devices where in one device utilizes the ping command to test the network of the other device by mentioning the ip address of the other device. It sends an echo icmp data packet to the target device and waits for a response. the below command will ping www.google.com by sending 10 packets.

ARP
     
The ARP command is used to view and change the routing on a device. The protocol maps ip address to mac address of device that belong in a particular network. The below command displays the routing table. We can add and remove addresses using this tool.

Ifconfig

The interface used is ethernet cable. The MTU is 1500 bytes which is the maximum possible size of the packet that can be handled by the interface. txqueuelen is the length of the transmit queue. RX represents the number of packets recieved and TX represents number of packets transmitted.
