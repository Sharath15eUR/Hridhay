When 2 devices on the same network are assigned the same ip address it termed as an ip conflict. This will lead to communication problems in the network as it is difficult to differentiate between the 2 devices, as a result the data packets intended for one device may go to the other device in the network leading to data loss. Malicious users can listen to intercept the packets meant for the other device in the network due to this issue. To resolve this issue of ip duplication, whenever a device is assigned an ip address the existing devices in the network should be scanned if they have the same ip address then the ip addresss of the newly added device should be changed.
