Multi-Link Operation (MLO) is a feature that allows a device to use multiple frequency bands parallelly for communication between an AP and a client. It aggregates bandwidths across several links to work together in parallel. It synchronizes the transmissions at the Physical Layer. MLO reduces waiting times by sending packets over the least congested or fastest link. By combining bandwidth from multiple links, MLO significantly boosts total data transfer rates. If one link becomes busy or experiences interference, traffic can instantly shift to another link, minimizing delays.
