Without Target Wait Time (TWT) wifi devices would usually stay awake longer, constantly checking if thereâ€™s data to send/receive. This wastes battery, especially for IoT and mobile devices. With the introduction of TWT, devices sleep most of the time, only waking up for scheduled intervals. This saves a lot of battery energy, It reduces traffic congestion as device will be sleeping except for scheduled intervals. Devices only communicate when necessary, freeing up bandwidth for other active devices and making the overall network more efficient.
