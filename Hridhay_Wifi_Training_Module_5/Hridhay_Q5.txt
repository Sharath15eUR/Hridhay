Wi-Fi 6 operates on the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, striking a balance between coverage and speed. The 2.4 GHz band, in particular, offers longer range and better wall penetration. However, due to the heavy usage of these frequencies by many devices, Wi-Fi 6 networks may face interference and congestion. Despite this, Wi-Fi 6 introduces enhancements like improved resource management and efficiency to help alleviate some of the network congestion.

Wi-Fi 6E takes things further by utilizing the newly available 6 GHz band, which offers a significant amount of interference-free spectrum. This expanded bandwidth supports wider channels, boosting speeds and overall performance, particularly in crowded environments. However, the 6 GHz frequency has a shorter range and less ability to pass through obstacles compared to the lower frequencies. Nevertheless, the reduced interference and cleaner spectrum make Wi-Fi 6E an ideal choice for fast and reliable connectivity in spaces with numerous connected devices.
