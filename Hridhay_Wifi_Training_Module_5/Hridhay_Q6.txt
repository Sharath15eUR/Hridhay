Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be) has several new features :

1)Wider Channel Bandwidth (320 MHz):
It doubles the channel width compared to Wi-Fi 6, significantly boosting data speeds.
2)Higher-Order Modulation (4096-QAM):
By using 4K-QAM, Wi-Fi 7 enhances data transmission efficiency, offering roughly 20% faster speeds over Wi-Fi 6.
3)Multi-Link Operation (MLO):
Devices can connect across multiple frequency bands at the same time, improving reliability and minimizing delays.
4)Advanced MU-MIMO and OFDMA:
These technologies have been upgraded to allow better support for more users and optimize how bandwidth is shared.
5)Preamble Puncturing:
This feature enables the use of wider channels even in environments where parts of the spectrum are congested.
6)More Spatial Streams:
The number of spatial streams has increased up to 16, allowing even more data to be transmitted simultaneously.
