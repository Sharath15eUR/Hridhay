802.11k, 802.11v, and 802.11r work together to enable seamless and efficient roaming for Wi-Fi clients. 802.11k improves roaming decisions by providing the client with a neighbor report, listing nearby access points and their details, allowing the client to quickly identify the best AP to connect to without scanning all channels. 802.11v enhances this by enabling the network to assist clients with roaming decisions, suggesting optimal APs based on real-time load and signal quality, while also managing client behavior such as sleep and idle states. Meanwhile, 802.11r speeds up the handoff process itself by enabling fast, secure authentication with the new AP before the actual roam occurs. Together, these technologies reduce roaming delays, minimize connection interruptions, and provide a smoother, more reliable user experience.
