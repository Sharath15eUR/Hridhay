The 802.11r standard, also known as Fast BSS Transition, is designed to speed up the roaming process for Wi-Fi clients by simplifying authentication when moving between access points (APs). Typically, a device must complete a full re-authentication each time it switches APs, leading to delays. With 802.11r, devices pre-authenticate with nearby APs before actually roaming, allowing them to transition quickly without repeating the entire handshake process. This significantly reduces connection interruptions and latency, providing a smoother experience for users, especially in environments where mobility is critical, such as offices, hospitals, airports, and warehouses. It is particularly beneficial for real-time applications like voice and video calls, where seamless connectivity is essential.
